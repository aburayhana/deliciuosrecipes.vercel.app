Add the shredded cheddar to the ground beef pan and stir just until the cheese is combined with the meat. Spoon the ground beef mixture on to the bottom buns. Sprinkle shredded lettuce on top of the meat and then cover with top bun. Serve and enjoy!"

- "Serve on bun... add meat to the buns top with lettuce and add some more slice pickles."
- "Notes- I had to substitute what was fine, my kids donâ€™t like onions so this is what I used. And I was out of mayo so I used this. And everything still taste like a Big Mac. I made everything in the ninja foodie. I gave two different recipes on how to make this. Enjoy ðŸ˜‰ itâ€™s definitely worth trying if you like Big Macs or sloppy joes."
