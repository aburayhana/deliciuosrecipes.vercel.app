recipeingredient:
- "2 rolls of shortcrust pasty"
- " Leftover turkey ham stuffing and vegetables"
- "4 tbsp branston pickle"
- "2 handfuls grated cheese"
- "1 egg beaten"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 180 degrees c. Unroll the first roll of shortcrust pastry and cut a circle, the size of your baking tin, plus 1 cm. Place it inside the baking tin and prick with a fork. Set aside the remaining pastry for later."
- "Unroll the second sheet of pastry. Slice it in half length ways. Adjoin both slices together to make a long strip. Brush the rim of base pastry with water. Then line the sides of the tin with pastry. Cut off any excess length but allow the pastry to overhang the sides"
- "Line the pastry with baking parchment and cover with baking beads. I also placed a heat proof bowl into the tin, to keep the sides in place. Blind bake for 15 minutes."
- "Remove the pastry and allow to cool. Then begin layering your veg. I did turkey, sprouts, stuffing, ham, branston pickle and cheese - repeat."
- "Turn the oven down to 170 degrees c. Make a lid with the leftover pastry to make your pastry lid. Make sure it’s sung. Prick a few holes in the top and brush with the beaten egg. Bake for 30 - 40 mins or until the pastry is golden. You might need to adjust the temperature depending on your oven."
- "Remove and trim the excess pastry from the sides. Then place a plate or board on top of the pastry and flip it over to remove the pie from the tin. It should slide out. Then place a baking tray onto the bottom of the pie and flip back over so that the pie is facing upwards. If you want/need to crisper the bottom. Pop it back in the oven for 5 minutes or so. I tied a bit of string around the case to keep it intact."
- "Serve with hot gravy."
