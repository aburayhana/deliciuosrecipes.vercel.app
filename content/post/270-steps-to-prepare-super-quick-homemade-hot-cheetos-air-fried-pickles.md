recipeingredient:
- "3.5 cups allpurpose flour"
- "1 jar long sliced kosher dill pickles"
- "1 bag Hot Cheetos Regular"
- "2 large eggs"
recipeinstructions:
- "Blend the bag of hot Cheetos down to dust (bullets work best) Get the chips as grinder down as possible, until fluffy texture."
- "Beat the two eggs, set aside, get a large bowl for your flour and using a paper towel or clean rag, soak up as much moisture from the pickles as possible. Everything should be in their own bowls."
- "First taking the pickle, coat It in the flour, then dip completely into the egg mixture, then press into the hot Cheetos mix, repeat again to get a 2nd layer, back into the flour, egg then lastly hot Cheetos, set aside in a plate, repeat until you run out of hot Cheetos dust. You should be able to get 12-15 double coated pickle slices."
- "Using your air fryer, set temperature to 350 degrees and set the timer for 10 mins, flipping them over at 5 mins in. Sometimes I like mine a little more crunchy, so I go to 12-14 mins, but everyone has their own preferences."
- "Once all are done cooking set on a plate and garnish with parsley flakes and your choice of dipping sauces. Our favorites are Ranch Dressing and Nacho Cheese, also heard blue cheese works great."
